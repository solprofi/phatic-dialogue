The project contains a phatic dialogue chat widget.

There are some key pharases that you can use in order to get a response from Jason i.e. something about weather, well-being, greetings, jokes and wisdom.

There are 4 moods to Jason. If you greet him too many times he gets annoyed and his mood worsens. But there is a magic phrase that you can use, which can make Jason happy again. Otherwise, he won't be very talkative.
